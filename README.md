# Ethan's Wicked-Crazy-Good Chicken Tikka Masala

## Phase 1 -- Garam Masala, or: Your New Favorite Spice Blend

### Ingredients

* 1 tbsp ground cumin
* 1½ tsp ground coriander
* 1½ tsp ground cardamom
* 1½ tsp ground black pepper
* 1 tsp ground cinnamon
* ½ tsp ground cloves
* ½ tsp ground nutmeg

### Instructions

1. This is totally optional, but if you want to do this and you have the time/resources, go ahead and dry-toast these spices whole in a stainless steel pan until fragrant, then grind them yourself. 

2. Pretty much just throw these into a bowl, mix to combine with your implement of choice, and then you've got garam masala! 

### Notes

Again, grinding the spices yourself is totally optional, but from what I understand, largely worth it. However, pre-ground is good enough, and will still yield a tasty spice blend, and will be better than a pre-made blend you get out of a bag or something. Whichever method you use, personally, I tend to make this in bigger batches and then keep it around for use later, so definitely consider doing that for convenience's sake.

## Phase 2 -- The Marinade Connection

### Ingredients

* ~800g boneless/skinless chicken (breasts and thighs are both acceptable)
* 1 cup plain yogurt (not greek, not vanilla, just straight-up plain)
* 1½ tbsp garlic (minced)
* 1 tbsp ginger (grated)
* 2 tsp garam masala
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tsp ground cumin
* ½ tsp ground red chili powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt

### Instructions

1. Plop the yogurt into a large holding vessel of some sort. I prefer to use a large glass measuring cup/bowl.

2. Add the minced garlic, grate in the ginger, and evenly distribute the spices. Don't just pour them into a single spot. Do yourself a favor and ensure even coverage/distribution. 

3. Stir that bad boy until homogenous. 

4. Dice your chicken into bite-sized pieces. You know: the best size of pieces. 

5. Add the chicken to the yogurt mixture and stir until everything is covered with a cold little flavor blanket. Ideally, the chicken may be totally submerged.

### Notes

The marinade will still be effective even if started just ten minutes before cooking, but personally, I do it the night before and leave it (covered) in the fridge. This ensures maximum flavorage and is, as they say, "the move". Also, experiment with things! Test the levels. Use Kashmiri chili powder instead of the standard red if you'd like. Add something I didn't even list, if you'd like. Go hog-wild. Or chicken-wild, I guess. Just remember that there will be more spices to follow. Oh, and as for the garlic: jarred stuff is fine for convenience, and is admittedly what I use most of the time. You could also crush a few fresh cloves in. I do grate fresh ginger every time, though.

## Phase 3 -- It's Tikka Time, Baby

### Ingredients

* marinated chicken
* 2 tbsp ghee (or butter)
* 1 large yellow onion (diced)
* 1½ tbsp garlic (minced)
* 1 tbsp ginger (grated)
* 1½ tsp garam masala
* 1½ tsp ground cumin
* 1 tsp ground turmeric
* 1 tsp ground coriander
* 14 oz tomato puree (1 can, can-opened)
* 1 tsp ground red chili powder
* 1 tsp kosher salt
* 1¼ cup heavy cream (evaporated milk for low-cal)
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 2 tbsp neutral oil (optional)

### Instructions

1. To start, I recommend going ahead and divvying up your spices into their own small bowls for easy access while your pan is preheating. 

* Spice Blend Alpha: garam masala, cumin, turmeric, coriander
* Spice Blend Beta: chili powder, salt
* Spice Blend Delta: literally just the brown sugar

2. Pan-fry the chicken (oil optional, see below) in a high-walled sauté pan over medium-high heat for a few minutes. This can (and probably should) be done in batches to avoid over-crowding and steaming, unless your pan is wide enough. You don't necessarily have to cook the chicken all the way through, since it'll be simmering in the sauce for a while. Just make sure you get all of that marinade in there, too. Do NOT waste it. Once the chicken is done, put it aside and keep warm. I usually do this by popping it in the microwave and leaving it there. 

3. Throw the ghee/butter into the pan and sauté the onion until translucent and very fragrant, making sure to scrape everything up if applicable.

4. Once the onion has some good aromas and colors happening, add the garlic and ginger, then sauté for an additional minute or two. Do NOT burn the garlic, or you will have to start over. This is not a threat; it's a promise. And also a threat. 

5. Add Spice Blend Alpha to the party, making sure to sprinkle over the whole affair for even coverage, and then sauté everything for 30 seconds to a minute, or until extremely fragrant and reminiscent of why people say things like, "Cooking Indian food at home makes your whole house smell like Indian food for three days."

6. Add the tomato puree and Spice Blend Beta, then stir to combine, scraping everything back off the bottom. Take the heat down to just under medium, or wherever you feel comfortable simmering it at. Simmer that beautiful redness for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally to prevent potential burning. The color should deepen and the aromas and flavor will also intensify.

7. Stir in both the cream and Spice Blend Delta. Marvel at how genuinely beautiful it is to see the swirls of cream cascading over and throughout the tomato mixture. Mix thoroughly, then let simmer for a couple minutes.

8. Add the chicken very carefully (because if you go too fast, it WILL splash and bite you in the ass), making sure to get every last drop of juice and cooked marinade in there. Once, again, stir thoroughly, ensuring that the chicken is as submerged as possible. This is also the part where it turns neon orange, which is not only dope, but also extremely satisfying. Simmer your beautiful concoction for about 10-15 more minutes.

9. Kill the heat, and serve this hot jazz over/with whatever you'd like. My preference is noted below, along with a recommendation.

### Notes

You can initially pan-fry the chicken in a couple tablespoons of a neutral oil if you'd like, but personally, I find that the marinade lubricates everything enough to where the oil becomes a largely auxiliary presence. Totally your call.

As far as the tomato puree goes, definitely use tomato **puree** instead of tomato sauce. Canned tomato sauce is, in my opinion, way too sweet for this. The acidity of the puree cooks off and the puree provides a deeper flavor for the sauce. You could also use canned crushed tomatoes or crush your own tomatoes if you want to get fancy, but the canned puree is a very reliable choice. Also, I know that I switched from *grams* to *ounces* in the ingredients listing above, but I figured that was okay, since tomato puree commonly comes in 14oz cans. In grams, it's ~400g.

I like to serve this over jasmine rice. It makes for a really nice aromatic bed on which our tikka masala can rest its weary head. If you want to serve this alongside rice, I would recommend starting the rice around ~25 minutes before the tikka is done simmering. I know I said 10-15 minutes above for simmering the mixture after adding the chicken, but if you have the time, let then start the rice once you add the chicken, and let the chicken simmer until the rice is done cooking. It takes some getting used to, timing-wise, but is totally worth it.

Also, if you can make/acquire naan, then do so. Definitely a good addition. By the way, you'd normally garnish this with cilantro, but I have the whole soap thing, so I omit it. Why eat soap when you can have curry instead?
